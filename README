MY GAME DECISIONS:
stockpiles are of size <shape_size>
using DTET rotations system

ADDING YOUR OWN SHAPES:
In data.py, there is a dictionary called SHAPES.
    it maps shape sizes to a map from shape names (string) to Shape objects.
    (this means that if you want custom shapes without default shapes,
        you will need to delete the default shapes from this file.)
A Shape is constructed with a list of coordinate pairs (also lists).
    Each coordinate pair is an integer offset from a rotation coordinate pair.
    The constructor expects that all coordinate pairs are distinct.
    Some shapes you would expect the offset not to be in integers:
        The constructor will handle this.

ADDING YOUR OWN COLOR SCHEMES:
If you add more shape sizes,
create mappings to access each stockpile slot if neccessary
